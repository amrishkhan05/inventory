# Inventory

I started building this when I was preparing to move most of my stuff into self storage, I considered using a note on Google Keep for each box, but considering I was starting out with 19 boxes I decided that would become unruly.

The basic brief I set myself was:

 * Ability to manage boxes
 * Ability to manage what is in each box, as a list
 * Store data as JSON to allow it to be saved in Dropbox
